My developing research program focuses on the dynamics and development of perception, action, and cognition. I’m a postdoctoral fellow at Indiana University working with Drs. Chen Yu and Linda Smith. I’m lucky to be surrounded by dedicated mentors, stimulating collaborators, and wonderful researchers. 
 
My current research interests include:
* Examining the dynamics and development of perception/action.
* Understanding the role of early motor experiences for language, social, and attentional development.
* Working with awesome collaborators to construct causal models of multimodal dyadic interaction.
* Breaking down and modeling the temporal distributions that natural phenomena produce when perceiving, acting, and learning.
* Developing novel methods for quantifying behavior and coordination.

Please drop a line if you are interested in these topics and want to talk more about ideas, hypotheses, data/code, etc. I am starting to increase my open science practice. Check out my github and OSF contributions. More to come!
