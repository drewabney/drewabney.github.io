My current research interests include:
* [Examining the dynamics and development of perception/action.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/4714612/)  
* [Understanding the role of early motor experiences for language, social, and attentional development.](http://drewabney.github.io/files/Abney_etal_2018_CogSciProc.pdf)  
* [Working with awesome collaborators to construct causal models of multimodal infant-caregiver interaction.](http://drewabney.github.io/files/XuAbneyYu_2017_CogSciProc.pdf)
* [Breaking down and modeling the temporal distributions that natural phenomena produce when perceiving, acting, and learning.](http://drewabney.github.io/files/Abney_etal_2018.pdf) 
* [Developing novel methods for quantifying the temporal structure of behavior](https://dhabney.shinyapps.io/bursty_app/) 
and [how different types of temporal structure might impact memory and attention.](https://dhabney.shinyapps.io/Bursty_Activation/)
* [Creating computational techniques to index infant-caregiver physiological synchrony to better understand the developmental trajectories of co-regulation, self-regulation, and distress.](http://drewabney.github.io/files/SRCD_2019.pdf)

If someone asked me, "Hey Drew, what are the most representative papers of your past, present, and future research?". I'd give them a list of the following:

Please drop a line if you are interested in these topics and want to talk more about ideas, hypotheses, data/code, etc. I am starting to increase my open science practice. Check out my github and OSF contributions. More to come!
