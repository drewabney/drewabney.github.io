If someone asked me, "Hey Drew, what are the most representative papers of your past, present, and future research?". I'd give them a list of the following:

**Abney, D.H.**, Paxton, A., Kello, C.T., & Dale, R. (2014). Complexity matching in dyadic conversation. <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General<i>. [PDF](http://drewabney.github.io/files/Abneyetal_2014_JEPG.PDF) 

**Abney, D.H.**, Warlaumont, A. S., Oller D. K., Wallot, S., & Kello, C. T. (2017). Multiple coordination patterns in infant and adult vocalizations. <i>Infancy<i>. [PDF](http://drewabney.github.io/files/Abneyetal_2017_Infancy.pdf) 

**Borjon, J.**, **Abney, D.H.**, Smith, L.B., Yu, C. (in press). Developmentally changing attractor dynamics of manual actions with objects in late infancy. <i>Complexity<i>. [Open Access](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/4714612/) **Equal Contribution**.

**Abney, D.H.**, Dale, R., Louwerse, M.M., Kello, C. T. (2018). The bursts and lulls of multimodal interaction: Temporal distributions of behavior reveal differences between verbal and non-verbal communication. <i>Cognitive Science<i>. [PDF](http://drewabney.github.io/files/Abney_etal_2018.pdf) 


My current research interests include:
* Examining the dynamics and development of perception/action.
* Understanding the role of early motor experiences for language, social, and attentional development.
* Working with awesome collaborators to construct causal models of multimodal dyadic interaction.
* Breaking down and modeling the temporal distributions that natural phenomena produce when perceiving, acting, and learning.
* Developing novel methods for quantifying behavior and coordination.

Please drop a line if you are interested in these topics and want to talk more about ideas, hypotheses, data/code, etc. I am starting to increase my open science practice. Check out my github and OSF contributions. More to come!
