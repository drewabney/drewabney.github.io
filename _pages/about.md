My research is programmatic in pursuing the role of sensorimotor development in driving and constraining developmental change but pursues a number of phenomena – from reaching, to visual exploration, to vocalizations, to word learning, to human interaction – that are interrelated and provide important test beds for understanding developmental processes using ecological and complex dynamical systems approaches. My research studies utilize various techniques: from conducting controlled laboratory experiments to free-flowing toy play sessions to collecting daylong multimodal (e.g., vocalizations, body movements, etc.) behavioral data. I am motivated to apply existing techniques from applied computational social science and machine learning and develop new computational and analytic methods to understand the dynamics of development during infancy and early childhood. 

Starting August, 2019, I will join the faculty of the University of Cincinnati's [Department of Psychology](https://www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/psychology.html) and the
[Center for Cognition, Action, and Perception](https://www.artsci.uc.edu/cap.html) as an Assistant Professor.

Research Topics:

sensorimotor development; human interaction; perception/action; language development

Empirical Methods:
---------------------
