My research program focuses on studying the dynamics and development of perception, action, and cognition. I take a complex systems perspective to most of the problems that I study while utilizing and innovating quantitative and computational techniques/methods to better understand the rapidly changing behaviors of human infants. 

&ast;Starting August, 2019, I will join the faculty of the University of Cincinnati's Department of Psychology and the
[Center for Cognition, Action, and Perception](https://www.artsci.uc.edu/cap.html) as an Assistant Professor.&ast;

Research Topics:
----------------

sensorimotor development, human interaction, perception/action, language, memory

Experimental Methods:
---------------------
behavioral experiments, motion capture, eye-tracking, computational models, and corpus analysis
