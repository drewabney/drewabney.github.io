Chen Yu and Linda Smith. I’m lucky to be surrounded by dedicated mentors, stimulating collaborators, and wonderful researchers. 

Research Topics:
----------------
human interaction, perception/action, motor development, language, memory

Experimental Methods:
---------------------
behavioral experiments, motion capture, eye-tracking, computational models, and corpus analysis
