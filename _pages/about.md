My research program focuses on studying the dynamics and development of perception, action, and cognition. I’m a postdoctoral scholar at Indiana University working with Drs. Chen Yu and Linda Smith. I’m lucky to be surrounded by dedicated mentors, stimulating collaborators, and wonderful researchers.

Research Topics:
----------------

sensorimotor development, human interaction, perception/action, language, memory

Experimental Methods:
---------------------
behavioral experiments, motion capture, eye-tracking, computational models, and corpus analysis
